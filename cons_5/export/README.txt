# C5 Number Generator

## Overview

C5 Number Generator is a C++ application designed to generate and manage random numbers based on user
requirements. The application provides functionality for generating both integers and real numbers within
specified ranges. It operates as a server using XML-RPC communication, allowing remote clients to request
number generation, statistical information, listing of numbers, and more. The server and client components
enable seamless communication over a local network.

## Features

- Generate random integers and real numbers within specified ranges.
- Server-client architecture using XML-RPC for remote communication.
- Retrieve statistical information about the generated numbers.
- List and return generated numbers.
- Supports execution only on the local network.

## Prerequisites

To build and run the XML-RPC Server Number Generator and the XML-RPC Client, you need the following:

- C++ compiler that supports C++11 standard
- CMake (version 3.12 or higher)
